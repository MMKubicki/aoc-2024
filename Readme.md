# Advent of Code 2024

This time using deno for fun.

## Structure

Code should be put in folder `days` with name containing day number padded with 0 to two digets and `.ts` as ending, eg. `./days/02.ts` or `./days/14.ts`.
Input is to be put in folder `.aoc` with subfolder of day number padded with 0 to two digets, eg. `./.aoc/02/inputs.txt` or `./days/14/test.txt`.

## Run

Use `deno task run <day>` or `deno run --allow-read=.aoc,days main.ts <day>`
